<h1>Oxdav Project help file</h1>
  This is the file <a href="openXMLhelp.htm">openXMLhelp.htm</a>.
  This project is for managing hierarchical files
  such as this one, or <a href="hierarchy.html">hierarchy.html</a>.
  This is a link to <a href="http://www.google.com">google</a>.

<h2>Data Entry</h2>
  Save a strictly hierarchical file, h1-h2-&amp;c, file into the
  /oxdav (webdav) webapp; look for its echo in /oxdav/res.

<h3>Data Entry Tricks</h3>
  Create a table of Name-Value pairs, whatever you like:
  <p>
  <table border="1">
    <tr><th>Name</th><th>Value</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Author</td><td>Tom Myers</td></tr>
    <tr><td>keywords</td><td>entry,search,tables,name,value</td></tr>
  </table>
  </p>
  users can search for the pairs and find the subsection.
<h4> Copying self-links</h4>

  MSWord may munge the relative URLs in your file; make sure that you set
the base URL in the document properties to /oxdav/res, not just to oxdav.
