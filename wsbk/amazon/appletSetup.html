<p>Amazon applet setup. The applet itself is quite simple, but it needs to
make the connection to Amazon. This involves a security check: 
it is not safe in general
for applets to go all over the net, because then somebody could put
an applet on a web page which would connect you with the world in
ways you wouldn't know about. So, we can learn all about signing
applets, or we can learn all about the policy tools, or we can cheat.
<p></p>We're going to cheat: we're going to compile this soapUtil code 
from the classpath (from our WEB-INF/classes directory) via
<quote><pre>
  javac soapUtil/*.java
  jar -cf SoapApplet.jar soapUtil/*.class
</pre></quote>
and then move that jar to our JAVA_HOME's jre/lib/ext directory.
(If we have two, we'll put it in both just to save on thinking.)
That way, by default it has AllPermissions, as explained at
 <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/ext/security/policy.html">
   http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/ext/security/policy.html
 </a>. This is not the safest way, but for personal use it should be fine.
</p><p>The applet code also requires explicit use of Java's PrivilegedAction
class, which asks for the permission. (The answer is yes, but you do have to ask.)
</p><p> One final issue: you may need to install the Java Plug-In. (This should
have been installed with your installation of the JDK, but you might want to
check the Plug-In settings, e.g. in your Control Panel.)
