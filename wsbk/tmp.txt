In reading the book, I did not see too much that wasn't inherently cross-platform, but if you specifically wanted to cover how to set up the development environment on each platform, that couldn't hurt. I suppose the database stuff might be the trickiest, but even MySQL is part of Mac OS X (I think).


?I should have thought of that -- it seems to be true for the Server:

(In fact, I think I might refer to that specific article.)

> a/ I would prefer if you used Linux in the generic sense. In fact, if you are going to use Mozilla on Linux, it's probably enough to mention the revision of Mozilla you're using. Or, perhaps you should use Netscape and Mozilla on Linux (which are virtually the same thing, although Firebird is probably superior.)


I'm not sure what "Linux in the generic sense" means; would you actually
like us to say "Unix" rather than "Linux"? I'll test it on Mandrake, when
I get to it. Hm...

  http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html
has Win & Lin, but for OS X you go to http://www.apple.com/java/ no prob.

  http://www.mozilla.org/ has all 3 OSs (Lin needs "glibc2.2.4 or better");
and we were using Moz 1.4, not Firebird;

 I admit to being startled to see that
  http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-4.1-doc/RUNNING.txt
says to install on "Unix" from the same zip file as Win, I don't see any rpm
here any more, but I guess it shouldn't be an issue; anyway
  http://developer.apple.com/internet/java/tomcat1.html
seems to be pretty current for OS.X

  http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-4.0.html covers all OSs
and
 http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-jdbc-stable.html (Connector/J for mysql)
should have no problems on any of them;

 http://sourceforge.net/projects/jtidy may have to be recompiled; it's very
odd but I did find that when I did that with no changes I got rid of a
weird error message, but there's no issue with different platforms;

and I think that's all, except to copy two dozen .bat files as .sh, fix
their ^M^J to be just ^J, change %s to $s for variables, and..umm...all of
a sudden I don't recall how to say "pause" in a script. oh well, I wouldn't
be doing that today anyway. But I guess I'll do that, and it's probably
safe to say both "Linux" (unless you want to say "Unix") and "OS X" in
advertising material...I just don't see how it could fail to be doable.
In fact, right now I don't see how it could fail to be easy, which
probably means I'm missing something big. :-)
